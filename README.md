# Arduino-unu
This project is a simple demonstration on how to turn on and control the Arduino Uno using Serial communication. By utilizing the Serial.println() and Serial.readStringUntil() functions, the user can send commands to the Arduino to change the color of an LED connected to the board.

The code uses if statements to check for the user's input and execute the appropriate action. This allows the user to easily change the LED color by simply typing in the desired color through the serial monitor.

Overall, this project serves as a great introduction to basic Arduino programming and Serial communication. It is a fun and interactive way to learn about programming and electronics, and provides a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.

To learn more about this project, feel free to check out the code and follow along with the tutorial. With a few basic components and a little bit of code, you can turn your Arduino Uno into a powerful tool for learning and exploration!
